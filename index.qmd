## Bio

I am a Data Scientist with a background in Computer Science and a desire toward building products. What keeps me engaged in this field is its multi-modality; I enjoy the challenge of adapting to different domains, whether that means analyzing sleep patterns via EEG, interpreting music mood through Deep Learning, or engineering RAG systems for dynamic narratives.

Currently, I serve as a Task Leader for EU-funded research projects, where I implement Deep Learning algorithms with a focus on Explainable AI (xAI). While this work has honed my technical rigor—culminating in a workshop presentation in Bologna—my professional focus is shifting beyond the academic sphere.

I find the most satisfaction in the engineering side of Data Science: designing the architecture, handling the pipeline, and delivering a tangible, functional MVP. I am looking for opportunities to bring this end-to-end skillset to a product-focused environment.

## Experience

### Data Scientist & Research Associate
**Four-Dot Infinity** | *Athens, GR (Oct 2024 – Present)*

* **Task Leader (EU MANOLO Project):** Leading the Explainability and Robustness work package. I bridge the gap between abstract research and implementation by coordinating technical deliverables.
* **xAI Development:** Engineered a comprehensive suite of interpretability tools (SHAP, LIME, GradCAM) and authored novel evaluation metrics—specifically fidelity and surrogacy efficacy scores—to validate model trust.
* **Grant Writing & Strategy:** I contribute to European funding proposals, translating complex algorithmic concepts into compelling narratives for both technical and non-technical evaluators.
* **Research Dissemination:** Co-authoring academic papers to share project findings with the wider scientific community.

### Software Developer
**HQEngine** | *Melbourne, Australia (Remote) (Jun 2021 – May 2022 & Jun 2023 – Mar 2024)*

* **Full-Stack Product Dev:** Built features for a fintech startup focused on eInvoicing and ePayments using Ruby on Rails.
* **Compliance Engineering:** Integrated XML document generation for PEPPOL standards and implemented validation logic for Australian Business Numbers (ABNs).
* **Production Maintenance:** Performed full-stack debugging and optimization to ensure regulatory adherence and system stability.

### IT Specialist (ERP)
**Hellenic Army** | *Athens, GR (Jul 2022 – May 2023)*

* *Mandatory Military Service at the Special Army Unit Supply Center (EKEMS).*
* Managed commercial transactions and inventory logistics using the Entersoft Business Suite ERP.

### Informatics Intern
**Elxis Group** | *Athens, GR (Sep 2020 – Jan 2021)*

* **NLP Pipeline:** Managed real-time data collection from the Twitter API, filtering for earthquake-related events.
* **Data Annotation:** Used Prodigy for pre-processing and annotation to train a multi-class classification model for intensity prediction.

### Hobbies

- **Video Games:** Enthusiast of complex strategy games. I enjoy deconstructing the mathematical "meta" and economy flows behind the gameplay just as much as playing.
- **Audio Production:** I am an amateur musician armed with an electric guitar and experiment with MIDI to layer beats and ambient textures.
- **Tabletop & Wargaming:** My creative outlet lies in painting Warhammer miniatures and writing homebrew D&D campaigns.
- **Cross-fit:** To clear my mind i am committed to high-intensity functional training and personal discipline through cross-fit and functional training.
